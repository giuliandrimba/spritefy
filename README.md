# Spritefy-Build

Spritefy-Build is a command line tool to generate images spritesheet and css3 animations.

# Installation

	npm install -g spritefy-build

# Usage

On OSX, open Terminal, and type:

	spritefy -s <sprite_name> -d <images_dir>

Where **-s** is the name of the sprite and the css3 animation, and **-d** is the path to the directory which contains the images sequence.

It will generate a folder called **sprites** in the same directory of the **images folder**, containing the image sprite and the css file with the animation of the sprite.

## Example

Suppose I have a folder with an image sequence of pngs generated by Adobe Flash or After Effects, and you want to animate it in HTML/CSS.

This folder is in "~/Desktop/animations/img"

I would open Terminal, navigate to the "animations" folder:

	cd ~/Desktop/animations

And run the spritefy command:

	spritefy -s sprite -d img/

It will generate a folder called "sprites" in "~/Desktop/animations/sprites", containing 2 files: sprite.png and sprite.css

To test the animation, just create an HTML file, load the css file into it, and assign a class to an element, where the name of the class is the name of the sprite, eg:

	<div class="sprite"></div>

# Compress option

If you want to compress the css file generated to optimize file size, run the command with the **-c** option, eg:

	spritefy -s sprite -d img/ -c

## Spritefy-Animation

To have more control of the animation, you could use the jQuery plugin [Spritefy-Animation]
