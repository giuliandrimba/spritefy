# Spritefy

Spritefy is a command line tool to generate images spritesheet and css3 animations.

Version 0.5.7

## Requirements

1. [ImageMagick]
2. [NodeJS]
3. [NPM]

[ImageMagick]: http://www.imagemagick.org/script/download.php "ImageMagick"
[NodeJS]: http://nodejs.org/ "NodeJS"
[NPM]: http://npmjs.org/ "NPM"

# Installation

	npm install -g spritefy
	
## Browser support

1. Safari 5.1+
2. Firefox 11+
3. Opera 11.62+
4. Chrome 18+

No toy for you IE (Internet Explorer doesn't support css animations)

## Usage

On OSX, open Terminal, and type:

	spritefy -n <sprite_name> -s <source_folder>

Where **-n** is the name of the sprite and the css3 animation, and **-s** is the path to the directory which contains the images sequence.

It will generate a folder called **sprites**, containing the image sprite and the css file with the animation of the sprite, and a folder **scripts** containing the jQuery plugin to control the animation.

## Example

Suppose I have a folder with an image sequence of pngs generated by Adobe Flash or After Effects, and you want to animate it in HTML/CSS.

This folder is in "~/Desktop/animations/img"

I would open Terminal, navigate to the "animations" folder:

	cd ~/Desktop/animations

And run the spritefy command:

	spritefy -n sprite -s img/

It will generate a folder called "sprites" in "~/Desktop/animations/sprites", containing 3 files: sprite.png, sprite.css and sprite-compressed.css, and a folder called "scripts" which contains the jquery plugin to control the css animation.

To test the animation, just create an HTML file, load the css file into it, and assign a class to an element, where the name of the class is the name of the [sprite]-animation, eg:

	<div class="sprite-animation"></div>

## Destination folder

If you want to build the files at a specific folder, run the command with the **-d <dest_folder>** option, eg:

	spritefy -n sprite -s img/ -d img-test

If the folder doesn't exist, it will be created.

## Usage

	$(<el>).spritefy(<animation_name>,<options>);

## Example

	$("#my_el").spritefy("sprite",{duration:1,count:5,onComplete:function(){console.log("completed")}});

## Options

1. **duration:[number]** - Total duration in seconds of the animation (for each iteration)

2. **delay:[number]** - Delay to start the animation

3. **count:[number] || "infinite"** - How many times the animation will run, set "infinite" for infinite loop.

## Controlling the animation

After you initialize the spritefy in the element, you will have access to the following methods:

1. **animation.play()** - Plays the current animation.

		$("#my_el").animation.play()

2. **animation.pause()** - Pauses the current animation.

		$("#my_el").animation.pause()

## Animation events

You can set callbacks for the following animation events in the options:

1. **onStart** - Triggered when the animation starts

		$("#my_el").spritefy("sprite",{onStart:startHandle})

2. **onIteration** - Triggered for each time the animation plays in the loop

		$("#my_el").spritefy("sprite",{onIteration:iterationHandle})

3. **onComplete** - Triggered when the animation ends

		$("#my_el").spritefy("sprite",{onComplete:completeHandle})
